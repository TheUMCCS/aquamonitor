			  	<span>One of the priority issues of the Gulf of Mexico Alliance (GOMA) is monitoring the state of water resources in and near the Gulf. To ensure that its water quality, and other management, goals are realized, GOMA is providing this on-line catalog of all programs or projects in the region that collect information on water quality, biological, biogeochemical and other variables. The GOMA Catalog of Monitoring Programs is publicly available, free of charge.</span>
